Embedded inside the Knoedler stock books are countless research questions that could develop into anything from an undergraduate seminar class to a PhD dissertation or an established scholar’s next manuscript. In the several minutes it takes to scroll through an excel spreadsheet with over 20,000 entries it’s easy to feel both excited and overwhelmed by the depth of information and scholarly potential available. How does one make sense of thousands of lines of data representing decades of the art market? More specifically, how do art historians, trained in visual analysis and critical thinking, effectively apply those same research skills to an excel spreadsheet? Simply put, they don’t.

Data visualization tools allow scholars to conceptualize large amounts of information. By turning daunting spreadsheets into visually intuitive graphs, pie charts, maps, word clouds and other visualizations, art historians can begin to ask more complex questions about large datasets now available online.

One of the most crucial and complex questions is how to use data visualization tools. Our team spent time discussing this question both with each other and with other scholars before diving in. Did we want to display widely known facts about art historical data? Or did we want to form our own conclusions and prove these conclusions through bar graphs and pie charts? The answer was neither. We didn’t want to answer questions. We wanted to ask them.

Our team used data visualizations as a digital methodology. We input large and varied amounts of data into programs with minimal learning curves to analyze different trends, ask questions about anomalies, and extract potential research topics. Here, we’ve described our individual experiments, successes, setbacks, and future possibilities.
