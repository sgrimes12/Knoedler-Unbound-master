Making visualizations of the data was part of the fun part for us. Finally, we took the data that's been carefully collected and structured, and plugged it into programs to see what happened. As a team with various backgrounds in the digital humanities, we explored some basic tools to create intuitive visualizations.

Our first data experiment was with <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/"target="_blank">Google Spreadsheets</a>, looking at sales by nationality over time, specifically the decades 1890s, 1900s, and 1910s. This was a fruitful time in Knoedler history when the gallery was entering the market with full force. We were curious about what, if any, changes the gallery was making in its stock over time.

To discover this, we created simple pie charts, achieved by plugging a curated amount of data into a Google spreadsheet. By only including the information needed for the visualization, our data set was quite simple. We made three spreadsheets, one for each decade.

Google streamlines this process for the user. There's a small learning curve if the user is familiar with Excel.  In fact, we used Excel first with the large set of data containing all decades, then filtered by date and copied the relevant data into separate Google spreadsheets. This made it easy to count each nationality, make a two-columned table, and from there, use Google’s “Insert Chart” tool to choose a pie graph for visualization. The program is smart enough to suggest which chart works best with one's data, and has options ranging from pie and bar graphs to more complex histograms and scatter plots.

The largest shift in sales between 1890 and 1910 is the movement from French to American. In the 1890s, French artists had over 50% share of all works sold by Knoedler, but by 1910 this had decreased to just over 30%, with American sales growing from 8.9% in 1890 to almost a quarter at 21.1% in the 1910s.
