Making visualizations of this data is the fun part, at least for us. Finally, you get to take the data that you’ve carefully collected and structured, and plug it into programs to see what happens. As a relative novices with technology, we stuck to some basic tools to create some basic, yet still enlightening visualizations.

Our first data experiment was with <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/"target="_blank">Google Spreadsheets</a>. We decided to take a look at sales by nationality over time, specifically the decades 1890s, 1900s, and 1910s. This was a fruitful time in Knoedler history when the gallery was getting off their feet and entering the market with full force. We were curious what, if any, changes the Gallery was making in their stock over time.

To discover this, we created simple pie charts, achieved by plugging a curated amount of data into a Google spreadsheet. We only included the information needed for the visualization, so the data set is quite simple. We made three spreadsheets, one for each decade.

Google makes this process streamlined, and it’s similar enough to Excel to have a relatively small learning curve. In fact, we used Excel first with the large set of data containing all decades. Then filtering by date and copy/pasting the decades into separate Google spreadsheets made it easy to count each nationality, make a two-columned table, and from there, use Google’s “Insert Chart” tool to choose pie graph. The program is smart enough to suggest which chart would work with your data, and has options ranging from pie and bar graph to more complex histograms and scatter plots.

As you can see quite clearly, the largest shift between 1890 and 1910 is the movement from French to American. In the 1890s, French artists had an over 50% share of all works sold by Knoedler, but by 1910 this had decreased to barely over 30%, with American sales growing from a measly 8.9% in 1890 to almost a quarter (21.1%) in the 1910s. This confirmed the narrative generally accepted by history, that Knoedler shifted over this time period from French to American paintings. However, it's enlightening to see it in visual form.
