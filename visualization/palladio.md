Our second foray into visualizing the data, we decided to leave the safety of Google behind and try out Palladio. This platform gives more ability to create relationship graphs, more complex images showing relationships between columns from your dataset. We decided to focus on one particular buyer, Henry Clay Frick, as he purchased almost 200 works from Knoedler during the time period available. 200 is not a large dataset, but Palladio, as a web-based application, works better with smaller sets anyway. First, we looked at sales by nationality, which didn't produce a very interesting graph. Then we decided to look at time, and who was selling the pieces Frick was buying to see if there was a correlation between where the piece was coming from, and what nationality the artist was.

In these two relationship graphs, a few things become clear. In the first graph, we see the same kind of disparities between nationalities as before. Frick mostly bought French, British or Dutch works, and during this time period, Knoedler sold a majority of those works. However, Frick's tastes don't seem to be lining up with the rest of Knoedler's buyers when it comes to American paintings. He only purchased a few, less than 10 of the total 173\. But in some ways he was with the trend, as those American painting purchases occur across a wide swatch of time--from 1894 all the way to 1919\.

The second graph also both highlights and challenges the traditional narrative of Knoedler sales. Here we see sellers in a dark grey circles and artist nationalities in the lighter grey. Not surprisingly, we see dealers like Durand-Ruel, Jacques Seligmann and Georges Petit clustered on the French side of the diagram. On the other hand, Duveen is clearly linked to an American sale, which seems to disprove thought that Duveen did not deal in American pictures. Upon further research, I discovered this sale was [Gilbert Stuart's Portrait of George Washington](http://collections.frick.org/view/objects/asitem/items$0040:261), now in the Frick Collection in New York.

This process of curating data and intrepreting visualizations was new for us but we discovered quickly that there are many programs available to those with limited technological knowledge. In fact subject knowledge served us well.
