Our second foray into visualizing the data, we left the safety of Google behind and tried out <a href="http://palladio.designhumanities.org/#/">Palladio</a>. This platform has ability to create relationship graphs, more complex images showing relationships between columns in your dataset. We decided to focus on a particular buyer, <a href="http://www.frick.org/collection/history/henry_clay_frick"> Henry Clay Frick</a>, as he purchased almost 200 works from Knoedler during the time period available. 200 is not "big" data, however Palladio, as a web-based application, works better with a smaller set. First, we looked at sales by nationality, which did not produce a very interesting graph--it just showed artist's nationalities connected to their names. Then we looked at changes over time in who was selling what Frick was buying. We wanted to see if there was a correlation between where the piece was coming from, and what nationality the artist was.

In these two relationship graphs, a few things become clear. In the first graph, we see the same kind of disparities between nationalities as before. Frick mostly bought French, British or Dutch works, and during this time period, Knoedler sold a majority of those works. However, Frick's tastes don't seem to be lining up with the rest of Knoedler's buyers when it comes to American paintings. He only purchased a few, less than 10 of the total 173\. But in some ways he was an atypical buyer, as those American painting purchases occur across a wide swatch of time--from 1894 all the way to 1919\.

The second graph also both highlights and challenges the traditional narrative of Knoedler sales. Here we see sellers in a dark grey circles and artist nationalities in the lighter grey. Not surprisingly, we see dealers like [Durand-Ruel](http://research.frick.org/directoryweb/browserecord.php?-action=browse&-recid=6155), [Jacques Seligmann](http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/jacques-seligmann--co-records-9936) and [Georges Petit](http://data.bnf.fr/12163081/galeries_georges_petit_paris/) clustered on the French side of the diagram. On the other hand, [Duveen](http://primo.getty.edu/GRI:GETTY_ALMA21124730440001551) is clearly linked to an American sale, which seems to disprove thought that Duveen did not deal in American pictures. Upon further research, I discovered this sale was [Gilbert Stuart's Portrait of George Washington](http://collections.frick.org/view/objects/asitem/items$0040:261), now in the Frick Collection in New York.

This process of curating data and intrepreting visualizations was new for us but we discovered quickly that there are many programs available to those with limited technological knowledge. In fact subject knowledge served us well.
